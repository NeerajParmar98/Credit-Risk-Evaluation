The analysis and modeling process effectively identifies patterns in the bankloans.csv dataset. After handling missing values by removing rows with null entries, a Random Forest Classifier was trained on the cleaned data. The model achieved good performance, as evaluated through accuracy, precision, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. However, the dataset exhibited class imbalance, which might affect the model's ability to predict the minority class (default=1). Addressing this imbalance using oversampling techniques (e.g., SMOTE) or class weighting can further enhance model performance. Feature importance analysis highlighted the most significant predictors, providing insights into the factors influencing loan defaults.
