# Credit-Risk-Evaluation
The project successfully demonstrates the evaluation of credit risk using the bankloans.csv dataset. The analysis began with data preprocessing, including handling missing values and standardizing features. Key steps in exploratory data analysis, such as visualizations of the target variable (default) and feature correlations, provided critical insights into the data.

A Random Forest Classifier was employed to predict loan defaults, achieving satisfactory performance as measured by accuracy, precision, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. The confusion matrix and ROC curve illustrated the model's ability to differentiate between defaulters and non-defaulters effectively. Feature importance analysis identified significant predictors, such as income, debt-to-income ratio, and credit debt, which are crucial factors in assessing credit risk.

Key Insights:
Class Imbalance: The dataset exhibited an imbalance in the target variable, which could affect the model's ability to predict defaulters accurately.
Feature Relevance: Features like debt-to-income ratio and credit debt are strongly associated with default risk, providing actionable insights for credit risk assessment.

Conclusion:
The project provides a robust foundation for credit risk evaluation, identifying key factors influencing loan defaults and offering a predictive model to aid in decision-making. These insights can guide financial institutions in managing credit risk more effectively.
